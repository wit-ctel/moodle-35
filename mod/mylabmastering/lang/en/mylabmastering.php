This integration provides:

* Single sign-on (SSO) from the Moodle course into the MyLab & Mastering course. This standards-based integration uses IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), a proven integration protocol.
* Links to Pearson MyLab & Mastering courses ensure the student is presented with the educational materials they need within the context of the Moodle course frame.';
