GENERAL
-------
This enrollment plugin can digest XML from the Luminis Message Broker , allowing realtime Banner to Moodle integration,
as well as full XML extractions from Banner.

You can use this module with or without Luminis Message Broker. If you do not use Luminis Message Broker, you can instead use
this module to import XML files from banner on a manual or automated basis.

I have tried to make this module as customizable as possible. If you need to make changes for your specific install, please let
me know, so I can look into making it into a preference item (also take a look at the todo list below).


INSTALLATION
------------
1. Make sure the folder is named lmb, then copy to the enrol/ directory on your Moodle server.

2. Login to your Moodle server as an admin user, and visit the 'Notifications' page. Moodle will run through the install process.

3. Under Site Administration > Plugins > Enrolments > Manage enrol plugins, enable Banner/Luminis Message Broker.

4. Click settings Banner/Luminis Message Broker, and configure as desired.
NOTE: You must save the setting at least once, even if you don't make any changes, before you use this module. This is a
bug that will be fixed later.


LMB
---
You can configure, through the Luminis Message Broker interface, the LMB module to be a HTTP consumer. You should point it to
enrol/lmb/secure/liveimport.php on your Moodle server, and enter the LMB Security Username and Password that you entered in the
module settings. You should only use SSL (HTTPS) to ensure security of the interface.


USAGE
-----
When used with the Luminis Message Broker, you will generally import a complete XML from banner before the start of a
term/semester, and the Luminis Message Broker will continuously send messages that will keep Moodle up-to-date throughout the term. 

If you are using this module without Luminis Message Broker, you can configure the module to import a full XML file on a regular
basis. To do this, call cli/fileprocess.php or cli/folderprocess.php from a script or cron, much in the same way that the Moodle
cron is polled.

You should disable users from being able to change the course and user idnumber fields, these are used by this module to track users
and courses.

When doing mass imports, terms should come before courses and then crosslisted courses, users should come before enrolments (which
need to come courses and crosslistsing). 


MULTI-FILE EXTRACTS
-------------------
Place a directory at the XML Folder path that you have specified in the settings. In this folder, place any XML files to be
processed (only files that end in .xml will be processed).

When this is complete, you call extractprocess.php or cli/folderprocess.php to preform the extract.

If you want to use status files, the folder and all files need to be writable by the web user. When the files are ready, add a file
named 'start' to the folder.

When the processing starts, the module will remove the file 'start', and create a file called 'processing'. After extract processing
has completed, the 'processing' will be removed, and a 'done' file created. These status files allow people/scripts to check the
state of the run. It is important that the XML files are not modified/replaced while the extract is processing, or inconsistent
results may occur. Should a problem occur during extract, such as the process dies, or the XML files are inadvertently
modified/removed, it is safe to re-process the extract with a consistent set of XML. 

In the event an incomplete XML set is processed, students/instructors may be inadvertently removed from their courses. Re-processing
with a complete XML set will reinstate users into their courses and no data is lost.
